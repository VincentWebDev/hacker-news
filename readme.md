Project: Hacker News Clone taught by Reed Berger from Scrimba

This is a workalong course and not my own solo project.

Essential Concepts:

- Fetching news from the Hacker News API
- Routing with multiple pages
- Breaking app into components
- Managing state with reducers

Note: Doesn't save state after browser refresh
